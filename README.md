# SlimMicroService
The goal of this micro service is to provide a minimum viable service which performs validation of entities by using the schema of the underlaying storage. So sorry girls noSQL not included, joke aside you can as well provide a validation schema for your entities.
## Requirements
* PHP
* MySQL (to run the included example)
* phpcpd, phpcs, phpdoc, phpunit & ant (only if you want to run the full build)
## Installation
```
composer require mlatzko/SlimMicroService
```
## Run the service on localhost:8080
```
./run.sh
```
