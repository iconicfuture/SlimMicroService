# SlimMicroService
The goal of this micro service is to provide a minimum viable service which performs validation of entities by using the schema of the underlaying storage. So sorry girls noSQL not included, joke aside you can as well provide a validation schema for your entities.
## Installation
```
composer require mlatzko/SlimMicroService
```
